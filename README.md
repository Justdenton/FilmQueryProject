# FilmQueryProject

** Overview
The Film Query Application project is a command line application that retrieves and displays film data (alternative to using MySQL). 

** Technologies Used: 
Eclipse IDE, Java, SQL, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), git, GitHub. 

** Lessons Learned: 
	* In Java, we can use the JDBC API to run SQL commands from our application code.
		** JDBC : Java Database Connectivity 
		** API : Application Programming Interface
		** SQL : Structured Query Language
	* Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used to convert data (ex. Film class maps to the film table in the database). 
	* JDBC is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with relational databases.
